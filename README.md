INTRODUCTION
This project is a top-down zombie shooter game that has progressive waves, multiple guns and three difficulties. It also has a LAN based multiplayer option for players to play with their friends (still fixing bugs).

HOW TO LAN
Currently, the port and server address appear in the console (which will be changed later on). After selecting the multiplayer option and join, you will be prompted the server port and address (to join).
This information will be displayed on the host computer's console (if running using an IDE like Eclipse).
